# Lando

Lando is an application that applies patches and pushes them to Git and Mercurial repositories.

## Development

### Contributing

- All contributors must abide by the Mozilla Code of Conduct.
- The [main repository](https://github.com/mozilla-conduit/lando) is hosted on GitHub. Pull requests should be submitted against the `main` branch.
- Bugs are tracked [on Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org), under the `Conduit :: Lando` component.
- It is recommended to fork the repository and create a new branch for each pull request. A good convention to use is to prefix your name and bug number to the branch, and add a brief description at the end, for example: `sarah/bug-4325743-changing-config-params`.
- Commit messages must be of the following form: `<module name>: <brief description> (bug <bug number>)`.
